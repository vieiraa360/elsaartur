    content: "I offer online counselling via video call and telephone, providing flexible and accessible therapeutic support from the comfort and convenience of your chosen location.\n\n## Benefits of Online & Telephone Counselling\n\nOnline therapy offers numerous advantages that can make accessing support easier and more comfortable:\n\n### Therapy in a place and time that suits you\nNo need to travel or worry about parking. You can have your session from the comfort of your own home, during a lunch break, or any location where you feel safe and comfortable.\n\n### Secure encryption software offers confidentiality and peace of mind\nI use secure, encrypted video platforms that prioritize your privacy and confidentiality, ensuring that our sessions remain completely private.\n\n### Anonymity\nFor some clients, the ability to access therapy without being seen entering a therapist's office can reduce anxiety and increase comfort in seeking help.\n\n### Access to counselling may be more immediate\nOnline sessions often allow for more flexible scheduling and can eliminate waiting times associated with geographical limitations.\n\n### Additional Benefits\n- **Accessibility for those with mobility issues** or living in remote areas\n- **Consistency of care** when traveling or relocating\n- **Reduced time commitment** without travel to and from appointments\n- **Comfort of familiar surroundings** can help some clients feel more at ease\n\n## Things to Consider About Online Counselling\n\nWhile online counselling works wonderfully for many people, it's important to consider whether it's the right fit for you:\n\n### Are you comfortable with using internet technology?\nYou'll need basic familiarity with video calling software. I can provide guidance on setting up and using the platforms we'll use.\n\n### Do you feel your situation is too complex to discuss via a video or telephone call?\nSome clients prefer the physical presence of face-to-face therapy, particularly when working through very complex or intense issues.\n\n### Is there a device you can use privately without interruption?\nEffective therapy requires a private, quiet space where you can speak openly without being overheard or interrupted.\n\n## Is Online Counselling Right for You?\n\nNot everybody will be comfortable with online or telephone counselling and I will advise you if face to face counselling, or some other form of support might be more suitable for you.\n\nDuring our initial consultation, we can discuss:\n- Your comfort level with technology\n- Your privacy and space arrangements\n- Your specific therapeutic needs\n- Whether online therapy feels like the right fit\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\nFor online sessions, you'll need:\n- A stable internet connection\n- A device with camera and microphone (laptop, tablet, or smartphone)\n- A quiet, private space\n- Headphones (recommended for better audio quality and privacy)\n\n## The Same Quality of Care\n\nResearch has shown that online therapy can be just as effective as face-to-face therapy for many concerns. The therapeutic relationship—the foundation of effective therapy—can develop just as deeply through video sessions as in person.\n\nWhat matters most is not the medium, but the quality of connection, understanding, and support within the therapeutic relationship.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you're interested in exploring online counselling or supervision, please get in touch. We can discuss your needs, answer any questions you have about the process, and determine together whether online therapy is the right fit for you.\n\nYour healing journey deserves to be accessible, convenient, and effective—and online counselling can offer all three.",

## A Supportive Supervisory Relationship

You will feel supported, your theoretical approach respected and you can express yourself without judgement and grow.

    excerpt: "As a humanistic counsellor using the Clarkson model of integration and informed short-term therapies, we can establish a mutual agreement to engage in 6-12 sessions focused on specific issues and exploring potential solutions.",
    content: `As a humanistic counsellor using the Clarkson model of integration and informed short-term therapies such as **brief therapy**, **compassion focused therapy (CFT)** and **acceptance committed therapy (ACT)**, I offer a focused and time-limited approach to therapeutic work.

## The Structure of Short-term Therapy

In our collaborative work, we can establish a mutual agreement to engage in **6-12 sessions** before evaluating our progress. Throughout this process, my role will be to provide support as you concentrate on specific issues and explore potential solutions.

## A Collaborative Approach

While I can offer guidance, structure, and techniques as needed, the transformative breakthroughs and insights you experience will predominantly emerge from our profound focus on your concerns. This approach empowers you to:

- **Identify specific goals** and work towards them efficiently
- **Develop practical coping strategies** for immediate challenges
- **Gain new perspectives** on current difficulties
- **Build resilience** and self-awareness in a focused timeframe

## Who Benefits from Short-term Therapy?

When you opt for brief and focused counselling, you may be facing:

- Workplace-related stress
- Life transitions or adjustments
- Specific anxiety or stress-related issues
- Decision-making challenges
- Recent losses or changes
- Relationship difficulties

Short-term therapy is particularly effective when you have a clear goal or specific issue you'd like to address, and you're looking for practical strategies and insights within a defined timeframe.

## Flexibility in the Therapeutic Process

However, it's important to note that the distinction between short-term and long-term approaches can change. Occasionally, individuals initially seek brief and focused work but later choose to continue for an extended duration, delving into deeper aspects of their experiences.

This flexibility ensures that therapy adapts to your evolving needs. Some clients find that working on a specific issue opens doors to deeper self-exploration, while others appreciate the focused, time-limited nature of short-term work.

## Therapeutic Approaches in Short-term Work

### Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT)
CFT helps you develop a compassionate relationship with yourself, particularly useful when dealing with self-criticism, shame, or harsh inner dialogue.

### Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
ACT focuses on accepting what is outside your control while committing to actions that enrich your life, aligned with your personal values.

### Brief Therapy
Brief therapy emphasizes solution-focused approaches, helping you identify what's working and build on your existing strengths.

## Making the Decision

Whether short-term therapy is right for you depends on your current needs, goals, and circumstances. During our initial consultation, we can discuss your situation and determine the most appropriate approach. Remember, you're always in control of your therapeutic journey, and we can adjust our approach as needed.

If you're dealing with a specific challenge and want focused, practical support, short-term therapy might be the ideal starting point for your healing journey.`,

    content: `Long-term Therapy can be compared to an **immersive journey of self-discovery** that we board on together within a supportive therapeutic alliance. This journey encompasses a range of experiences—it can be captivating, an eye-opening, but it can also be intimidating, and distressing at times, however, the rewards that await are fulfilling.

## The Goal of Long-term Therapy

The goal is that together we can go on a profound journey of exploring the complexities of your thoughts, feelings and behaviours that have become deeply ingrained in your psyche and frequently they become patterns of relating. By starting this path of self-discovery, you will develop a deeper understanding and self-awareness, laying the foundation for personal development and the capacity to start making changes for the better in your life.

## Exploring Past, Present, and Future

While our main point of focus will be the present, we'll also delve into your recollections from the past and your worries for the future. By highlighting these factors, we will also examine how past memories and future concerns influence your current experiences.

## Connecting with Yourself

Long term psychotherapy gives you the opportunity to connect with aspects of yourself, as you may be able to link patterns and unfold certain aspects of yourself. Through this process, you may discover:

- **Deep-rooted patterns** that have shaped your relationships and behaviors
- **Underlying beliefs** about yourself and the world
- **Emotional connections** between past experiences and present reactions
- **New possibilities** for growth and change

## Who Benefits from Long-term Therapy?

You may seek long-term psychotherapeutic counselling if you feel you need to gain more insight into the issues you're facing or if you need to have the time to unpacking distressing and at times traumatic issues.

Long-term therapy is particularly beneficial for:

- Complex trauma or developmental trauma
- Deep-seated patterns affecting relationships
- Chronic anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns
- Those seeking profound personal growth and self-understanding
- Individuals wanting to explore existential questions about meaning and purpose

## The Therapeutic Journey

This is not a quick fix, but rather a committed exploration of your inner world. The therapeutic relationship itself becomes a vessel for healing—a safe, consistent space where you can:

- Express yourself without judgment
- Explore difficult emotions and memories
- Practice new ways of relating
- Build trust and learn healthy attachment
- Experience being truly seen and heard

## A Collaborative Process

Regardless of the circumstances, I am here to support you in finding your own path forward. Long-term therapy is a collaborative journey where you are the expert on your own life, and I provide the professional guidance, tools, and safe space needed for your healing and growth.

If you're considering long-term therapy, know that this commitment to yourself is an investment in your future well-being, your relationships, and your capacity to live a more authentic and fulfilling life.`,

    excerpt: "Over the past 17 years of working as a therapist, it has become clear that more parts of a person emerge during therapy sessions than just their immediate presence. One such component is the 'inner child'.",
    content: `Over the past 17 years of working as a therapist, it has become clear that more parts of a person emerge during therapy sessions than just their immediate presence. One such component, referred to as the **"inner child"** by many psychotherapists, emerges. This inner child is a portion of a human that is not always playful, but rather reflects the child within who was born with two major needs: physical needs and loving needs. Attachment problems can emerge if the latter is not met. Within the Clarkson relationship model, the concept of reparenting, or repair, is very important in the process of working with the inner child.

## The Therapeutic Process

In this therapeutic process, I can provide nurturing support and create a safe environment to help you identify, connect with, and attend to the wounded, lost, or traumatized parts of yourself. I integrate various techniques, such as:

- **Grounding exercises** to empower you with safety and presence
- **Mindful inquiry** where we use bodily awareness to listen and connect these parts
- **Representational work** using objects like Russian dolls, toys, drawing and most importantly your imagination, to enable interactions between different dimensions of yourself

## Understanding Emotional Triggers

When we find ourselves experiencing exaggerated emotional reactions in our adult lives, it often indicates that a younger part of ourselves has been triggered. By recognizing and addressing these younger parts, we create distance from our emotional reactions, allowing us to provide them with the support they need.

Our inner children, with their lack of experience and early stage of development, their potential wounds and traumas, and their intense feelings of stress, hurt and loss, are ill-equipped to handle the challenges of adulthood. However, we often entrust them with running our lives.

## The Transformation

Based on my experience, when we take care of our inner children and relieve them of the burdens of adult life, our lives become more empowered. We find ourselves liberated to respond to life more authentically in the present moment as the child within is now feeling safe to be the child.

## Understanding Trauma: Gabor Maté's Perspective

Working with inner child trauma, I follow what Gabor Maté, a renowned expert in the field of trauma, defines trauma as an experience or event that overwhelms an individual's capacity to cope and leaves a lasting impact on their emotional, psychological, and physical well-being.

According to Maté, trauma is not solely limited to extreme situations like war or abuse but can also arise from more subtle and cumulative sources, such as:

- Neglect
- Emotional invalidation
- A lack of nurturing in childhood

He emphasizes that **trauma is not defined by the event itself, but rather by the individual's subjective experience** and their ability to process and integrate the emotions associated with it.

Maté views trauma as a fundamental factor in understanding various mental health issues and advocates for a compassionate and holistic approach to healing and recovery.

## Beginning Your Journey

If you recognize yourself in these words—if you notice patterns of emotional reactivity, struggle with self-worth, or feel disconnected from your authentic self—inner child work might be a powerful avenue for healing. Together, we can create a safe space for you to reconnect with, nurture, and heal the younger parts of yourself that have been carrying burdens they were never meant to bear.`,

    excerpt: "In the world of therapy, much focus is placed on understanding the mind, thoughts, and emotions. However, an often-overlooked aspect of healing lies within the body itself. This is where somatic therapy comes in.",
    content: `In the world of therapy, much focus is placed on understanding the mind, thoughts, and emotions. However, an often-overlooked aspect of healing lies within the body itself. This is where somatic therapy comes in as a powerful and transformative approach that recognizes the deep connection between mind and body.

## What is Somatic Therapy?

Somatic therapy is an integrative approach that focuses on the body's sensations and experiences in the healing process. The word **"somatic"** comes from the Greek word *soma*, meaning body. In somatic therapy, the belief is that our bodies hold onto emotional and physical experiences, particularly those related to trauma, stress, and unresolved emotions. These unresolved experiences can manifest as physical tension, pain, or discomfort. Somatic therapy helps individuals become more aware of these bodily sensations and use that awareness to release stored emotions and heal.

## The Mind-Body Connection

We've all experienced moments when emotions or stress seem to "settle" in our bodies—tight shoulders, a clenched jaw, or a knot in the stomach. Somatic therapy is based on the idea that the body's sensations are not just random feelings, but important signals that give us valuable insight into our emotional world. By tuning into these physical sensations, clients can connect with deeper emotions and past experiences, allowing for a more holistic approach to healing.

In traditional talk therapy, much of the focus is on verbal expression, yet somatic therapy encourages individuals to go beyond words. Through gentle guidance, a somatic therapist may help clients explore their bodily sensations, breath patterns, and movement. This focus on the body helps access emotions and memories that might be too challenging or difficult to express verbally, unlocking new pathways for healing.

## How Does Somatic Therapy Work?

Somatic therapy involves various techniques, including breathwork, body awareness, touch (with consent), movement, and mindfulness practices. One of the key goals of somatic therapy is to help individuals release stored trauma and build resilience to future stressors. By creating a safe space for clients to explore their physical sensations, somatic therapists guide clients to process and release emotional blocks that may have been stored in the body.

### Common Practices in Somatic Therapy:

**Breathing Techniques**: Conscious breathing helps to calm the nervous system, reduce anxiety, and increase emotional awareness.

**Body Awareness**: Clients are encouraged to focus on specific sensations, such as tension or discomfort, to uncover emotional patterns tied to the body's responses.

**Movement**: Gentle movement exercises can help release pent-up energy and emotions, allowing the body to re-establish a sense of flow and relaxation.

**Touch**: In some cases, touch may be used (with full consent) to help release tension or to guide clients through emotional processing.

**Grounding Practices**: These techniques help individuals reconnect with the present moment and gain a sense of stability and safety.

## The Benefits of Somatic Therapy

Somatic therapy can benefit individuals struggling with a range of issues, including trauma, anxiety, depression, chronic pain, and stress. Some of the key benefits include:

### Healing from Trauma
Somatic therapy can help individuals process and release trauma that may have been stored in the body, allowing for emotional and physical healing.

### Stress Reduction
By focusing on the body's response to stress, somatic therapy helps regulate the nervous system, reducing stress levels and promoting relaxation.

### Increased Self-Awareness
Somatic therapy encourages clients to tune into their bodies and gain a deeper understanding of how emotions manifest physically, fostering greater emotional intelligence.

### Improved Emotional Regulation
By becoming aware of bodily sensations, clients can better manage and respond to intense emotions, creating healthier emotional responses in daily life.

### Enhanced Mind-Body Connection
Somatic therapy promotes a more harmonious relationship between the mind and body, helping individuals feel more grounded and connected to their physical and emotional selves.

## Who Can Benefit from Somatic Therapy?

Somatic therapy is beneficial for anyone, whether they are experiencing specific trauma, emotional distress, or simply seeking to deepen their self-awareness. People struggling with chronic pain, anxiety, depression, or unresolved trauma may find somatic therapy especially helpful as it offers a different way to approach healing that incorporates both the mind and body.

For those who have found traditional talk therapy alone to be insufficient, somatic therapy offers an innovative and holistic approach that can complement other forms of treatment.

## Conclusion

The mind-body connection is a powerful and essential aspect of healing, and somatic therapy offers a unique way to access and release stored emotions that may be affecting both your mental and physical well-being. By focusing on bodily sensations and integrating them with emotional and psychological healing, somatic therapy helps individuals experience a profound sense of relief, release, and rejuvenation.

If you're interested in exploring somatic therapy and its potential benefits for your own healing journey, I invite you to reach out. Together, we can create a safe space for you to reconnect with your body, release stored emotions, and embark on a path toward holistic well-being.`,

    excerpt: "Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), also known as Tapping, is a powerful, evidence-based therapeutic tool that combines elements of acupuncture, cognitive therapy, and mindfulness to help release emotional blockages and promote healing.",
    content: `Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), also known as **Tapping**, is a powerful, evidence-based therapeutic tool that combines elements of acupuncture, cognitive therapy, and mindfulness to help release emotional blockages and promote healing. It involves tapping on specific meridian points on the body while focusing on an issue or negative emotion, helping to restore balance to the body's energy system and shift emotional responses.

## How Does EFT Work?

EFT works by addressing the emotional and psychological root causes of physical and mental distress. The process helps to reduce the intensity of negative feelings, thoughts, and trauma, making it an effective treatment for:

- Anxiety
- Stress
- Phobias
- Trauma
- Chronic pain
- Many other emotional challenges

## The EFT Process

During an EFT session, clients are guided to tap on key meridian points, such as:

- The top of the head
- Eyebrow
- Side of the eye
- Under the nose
- Under the collarbone
- Under the arm

While tapping on these points, clients verbally acknowledge the issue at hand. This technique is believed to help release energy blockages, allowing for emotional freedom and a greater sense of well-being.

## The Science Behind EFT

Research has shown that EFT can significantly reduce cortisol levels (the stress hormone) and help calm the amygdala, the part of the brain responsible for the fight-or-flight response. By combining physical tapping with cognitive acknowledgment of emotions, EFT creates a powerful mind-body connection that facilitates healing.

## EFT in My Practice

I integrate EFT into my practice as a tool for emotional healing and self-empowerment. By using this gentle yet effective technique, clients can:

- Achieve emotional balance
- Overcome limiting beliefs
- Transform negative patterns
- Create lasting positive change
- Develop self-regulation skills

## A Tool for Self-Empowerment

One of the greatest benefits of EFT is that it's a technique clients can learn and use on their own. Once you understand the tapping points and process, you have a powerful self-help tool that can be used whenever difficult emotions arise.

Whether you're dealing with anxiety, past trauma, or simply want to feel more emotionally balanced, EFT offers a gentle, non-invasive approach to healing that can complement other therapeutic work.

If you're interested in learning more about how EFT might help you, I'd be happy to discuss incorporating this technique into our work together.`,

    content: `With extensive experience in delivering training and counselling courses, I have had the privilege of guiding students through the CPCAB curriculum, from Level 2 to Level 4.

Over the years, I've developed a deep understanding of the skills and knowledge required to support and nurture future counsellors.

My approach to teaching is rooted in creating an engaging and supportive learning environment, where students are encouraged to explore and develop their own counselling abilities.

By combining practical insights with theoretical foundations, I aim to empower students to thrive in their professional journey and make a meaningful impact in the world of counselling and psychotherapy.

## Training Approaches

Evidence suggests that (once researcher allegiance effects are controlled for) there are no significant differences in effectiveness between approaches.

Most Counselling training is either within one theoretical framework or integrates several of these into an integrative model, which can then vary in terms of its theoretical basis.

In addition to different theoretical models, there appear to be differences in the 'level-ness' of courses.

This results in it not always being clear whether a counsellor has a qualification at pre-tertiary undergraduate or postgraduate level.

## The Professionalisation of Counselling

The professionalisation of Counselling has also been complicated due to the great diversity in approaches, training and employment/voluntary work settings.

In addition, practitioner psychologists and some practitioners in allied health professions, such as art therapists, have become regulated by the HCPC, but Counselling and Psychotherapy are not.

## Accreditation

There are currently two main bodies representing counsellors and psychotherapists – the **British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP)** and the **United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP)**. They serve as both membership organisations as well as upholding standards for professionals, although this has no legal standing.

Despite (or maybe because of) the long-standing absence of statutory regulation, BACP and UKCP accreditation have become 'industry standard' over the past years. UKCP accredits courses, and by following one of those courses, the individual student becomes accredited by UKCP.

### BACP Accreditation

The largest scheme, BACP accreditation, exists in two types: **course accreditation** and **individual accreditation**. Completing an accredited course does not confer automatic individual accreditation but makes the individual accreditation process less of an administrative burden.

Individual accreditation can be achieved by completing a course (accredited or not accredited, as long as core areas are covered) in addition to evidencing a minimum amount of client work that has to be accumulated post-training, and evidence of professional standing (assessed through the application process).

### Course Standards

For both schemes, courses can achieve accreditation by meeting certain standards of training. Courses generally must include minimum hours and standards of:

- Personal development
- Theory
- Ethical awareness
- Skills development

These rigorous standards ensure that counsellors are well-prepared to provide effective, ethical, and compassionate care to their clients.`,

According to the NHS, addiction is defined as **"not having control over doing, taking, or using something to the point where it could be harmful to you."** It is most commonly associated with behaviours like gambling, drug use, alcohol consumption, and smoking. However, it's possible to be addicted to just about anything, including:

- Work
- The Internet
- Solvents
- Shopping
- Gaming
- And many other behaviours

## DSM-5 and Addiction

In the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition), substance use disorders (SUDs) are characterized by a problematic pattern of substance use, leading to significant impairment or distress. This pattern is diagnosed based on the presence of at least two of the following criteria within a 12-month period:

1. **Impaired Control**: Difficulty controlling the behaviour or use of substances
2. **Social Impairment**: Failure to fulfil major obligations, social or interpersonal problems caused by substance use
3. **Risky Use**: Continued use despite physical or psychological harm
4. **Pharmacological Criteria**: Tolerance or withdrawal symptoms

A substance use disorder is a mental health condition that affects a person's brain and behaviour, causing them to lose control over their use of substances, such as legal or illegal drugs, alcohol, or medications. Symptoms range from mild to severe, with addiction being the most intense form of SUD.

## The National Institute of Mental Health on Addiction

Addiction is described as **"a solution that becomes a problem."** Dr. Gabor Maté, a well-known expert in the field, explains that addiction is manifested in any behaviour that a person craves and finds temporary relief or pleasure in, but suffers negative consequences from. Despite these consequences, the person finds it difficult to give up the behaviour.

## My Experience and Understanding of Addiction

Through my studies and work with leading rehabilitation centres, studying relapse prevention with experts like Terence Gorski, I've observed that **addiction often responds to trauma**. This has become evident through both my research and my experience. An informed trauma practitioner is essential in addressing addiction, but it is also important to understand how addiction affects the brain.

Addiction often develops as a way to self-regulate emotions or pain, which is why it's crucial for both trauma and addiction therapists to understand the trauma that shapes these behaviours. **Addiction is not just about willpower**—it involves the brain and emotional systems, which need to be addressed comprehensively in therapy.

## An Integrative Approach to Addiction in Therapy

With this understanding of addiction and trauma, I offer an integrative approach to working with clients who want to address addiction in my psychotherapy and counselling practice. By combining evidence-based therapeutic techniques with trauma-informed care, I help clients:

- Explore the root causes of their addiction
- Understand its impact on their brain and behaviour
- Work towards healthier ways of coping and self-regulation

This holistic approach not only addresses addictive behaviours but also supports long-term recovery by healing underlying emotional wounds and trauma. Recovery is possible, and it begins with understanding that addiction is not a moral failing, but a complex condition that deserves compassionate, informed treatment.`,

    content: `## As a Humanistic Integrative Counsellor, I Work with an Understanding of Existentialism

As a humanistic integrative counsellor, I draw upon the principles of existentialism to help clients explore and understand the deeper meaning of their experiences. Existentialism emphasizes personal freedom, choice, responsibility, and the search for meaning in an often uncertain world. In my practice, I work with the understanding that we are all individuals who have the power to shape our own lives, regardless of past experiences or current circumstances.

Existential therapy invites clients to confront the fundamental aspects of human existence—such as freedom, isolation, meaning, and mortality. It allows individuals to explore how they relate to these existential themes, which often underlie emotional struggles, anxiety, or feelings of emptiness. In a world where uncertainty and change are constant, existentialism offers a framework to find personal meaning and authenticity.

## Existence Precedes Essence

One of the core ideas of existentialism is the recognition that we are responsible for our own choices and the direction of our lives. Jean-Paul Sartre, a key figure in existential philosophy, famously said:

> *"Existence precedes essence."*  
> — Jean-Paul Sartre

This profound quote encapsulates the existential belief that we are not born with a predefined purpose or identity. Rather, we create our own essence through the choices we make and how we engage with the world. In therapy, I help clients understand that they are not bound by societal expectations, inherited roles, or past mistakes. Instead, they have the freedom to define their own path and create meaning in their lives, even in the face of challenges.

## Embracing Freedom and Authenticity

Through this humanistic approach, I support clients in embracing their freedom to make authentic choices, despite the uncertainties that life may present. We explore existential themes together, such as:

- **The search for personal meaning** - What gives your life purpose and direction?
- **Dealing with the anxiety of freedom** - How do we navigate the weight of our choices?
- **Accepting responsibility for choices** - Recognizing our power to shape our own lives
- **Facing life's inevitable uncertainties** - Finding peace with the unknown

My aim is to empower clients to live more fully and authentically, to recognize their own capacity for growth, and to find meaningful ways to engage with their world and relationships.

## Finding Your Own Path

Existential therapy isn't about finding predetermined answers or following a prescribed path. It's about helping you discover your own unique way of being in the world. Together, we explore what truly matters to you, what gives your life meaning, and how you can live more authentically in alignment with your values.

If you're feeling stuck, searching for meaning, or questioning your direction in life, existential therapy can provide a compassionate framework for exploring these fundamental questions and creating the life you want to live.`,

    content: `I believe in using a wide range of therapeutic tools to best support my clients on their journey toward healing and self-awareness. In addition to core humanistic principles, I integrate insights and techniques from Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and hypnotherapy to help clients unlock their potential, address limiting beliefs, and create lasting positive change.

## NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming)

NLP is a powerful set of techniques and models based on the idea that our thoughts, language, and behaviours are interconnected. In NLP, we focus on how the language we use—internally and externally—shapes our experience of the world. Clients can transform their emotional and psychological responses by identifying and changing unhelpful thought patterns or behaviours.

I use NLP techniques to help clients reframe their perceptions and beliefs in my practice. For example, if a client is struggling with anxiety, we might work together to identify and change the language and internal representations they use to describe stressful situations. By shifting the way they think and talk about the challenges they face, we can reduce their emotional distress and empower them to approach life with a more positive and resourceful mindset.

NLP also emphasizes the power of rapport and the importance of understanding how each person processes information. This understanding helps me tailor my approach to suit each client's unique needs and communication style, creating a more effective and personalised therapeutic experience.

## Hypnotherapy

Hypnotherapy involves guiding a client into a relaxed, focused state of awareness—known as a trance—where the mind is more open to positive suggestions, exploration, and change. In this state, clients are better able to access their subconscious mind, where deeply-held beliefs, memories, and emotions often reside.

I integrate hypnotherapy into my work to help clients access and address underlying emotional issues, such as trauma, anxiety, or self-limiting beliefs. Through guided relaxation and positive suggestions, hypnotherapy can help reprogram these unconscious patterns, encouraging the client to adopt healthier behaviours, beliefs, and emotional responses.

### How Hypnotherapy Works

Contrary to popular misconceptions, hypnotherapy is not about losing control or being manipulated. Instead, it's a collaborative process where the client remains fully aware and in control. The therapist acts as a guide, helping the client enter a state of deep relaxation where they can explore their inner world more freely.

In this relaxed state:
- The conscious mind becomes quieter
- The subconscious mind becomes more accessible
- Positive suggestions can be integrated more easily
- Deep-seated patterns can be explored and transformed

## Bringing It All Together

By integrating humanistic counselling with NLP and hypnotherapy, I offer a holistic, client-centred approach that addresses both the conscious and subconscious mind. This integrative model helps clients break free from limiting patterns, create lasting change, and build greater self-awareness and confidence.

Whether it's through reframing unhelpful beliefs with NLP or accessing the subconscious mind with hypnotherapy, I provide clients with the tools they need to overcome challenges and lead a more fulfilling, authentic life.

### The Benefits of an Integrative Approach

- **Personalized Care**: Different techniques for different needs and preferences
- **Deeper Access**: Working with both conscious thoughts and subconscious patterns
- **Faster Results**: Multiple therapeutic tools can accelerate the healing process
- **Lasting Change**: Addressing issues at multiple levels creates more sustainable transformation
- **Empowerment**: Clients learn practical tools they can use beyond therapy

My goal is to empower clients to recognize their own strengths and resources, so they can navigate life with greater ease, confidence, and resilience. Through this integrative approach, we work together to create meaningful, lasting change that honours your unique journey and potential.`,

## How to Find the Right Counsellor for Me?

Going through the many options for counselling and psychotherapy is not easy! While there is no magic equation for finding the right person for you, there are some important things to think about.

### How Are Counsellors Regulated?

Counselling isn't a government regulated profession, which means the title of 'counsellor' is not protected by law. Even a person with minimal training can call themselves a counsellor.

### Difference Between Registration and Accreditation

Registration does not replace accreditation. All practising BACP members must be registered or working towards registration. Accreditation is a quality standard for experienced practitioners, designed to recognise your capacity for independent, ethical and competent practice.

### How Important is BACP Accreditation?

BACP accreditation schemes aim to recognise the achievement of high standards of knowledge, experience and development in counselling and psychotherapy. They help clients, employers, practitioners and students to make an informed decision when choosing a therapist, service or training course.

If they are accredited, that gives you the security they had more hours of experience and had to go through an accreditation process. The BACP and the UKCP are the most used by counsellors and psychotherapists. Both organisations have directories of their members on their websites. Both the BACP and UKCP offer the ability to search by modality (the different ways of working), and there's a handy guide to different modalities on the BACP website.

**A BACP accredited member is an experienced practitioner who has:**

- A high standard of core training meeting substantial, specific BACP requirements for advanced practice
- Accumulated 450 or more fully supervised clinical practice hours, of which a third are post qualifying
- At least three years of clinical practice
- Supervision for a minimum of 1.5 hours per month while in practice

If you're looking for a therapist, you can feel assured that accredited members have met high standards of practice and are accountable to our accreditation standards.

### Do You Feel a Connection to the Person You Want to Work With?

Most counsellors offer an initial free consultation. This is a good opportunity to make sure you can feel comfortable with the counsellor, and feel if they are the right person for you. Research has shown that despite the approach of the therapist, **it is in the quality of the relationship that the work happens.**

### How Do You Want to Work?

In person, over video calls, on the phone, through instant messaging: therapy is delivered in all sorts of ways. Consider what format feels most comfortable for you.

## Still Not Sure How to Pick a Counsellor?

The BBC have a great seven-minute video on choosing the right therapist for you that is also worth a watch:

    excerpt: "Trauma can have a profound and lasting impact on our mental, emotional, and physical well-being. Learn about trauma-informed therapy and how this specialized approach prioritizes safety, trust, and empowerment in the healing journey.",
    content: `Trauma can have a profound and lasting impact on our mental, emotional, and physical well-being. It can shape how we view ourselves and the world around us, influencing our relationships, emotions, and behaviours. Healing from trauma often requires a specialized approach—one that is sensitive to the individual's needs and experiences. This is where a trauma-informed therapist plays a critical role.

## What Does It Mean to Be a Trauma-Informed Therapist?

Being a trauma-informed therapist means understanding that trauma doesn't just affect the mind, but also the body and spirit. It's an approach that prioritizes safety, trust, and empowerment. A trauma-informed therapist is not only aware of how trauma affects a client but is also equipped with the skills to create a space where healing can begin.

Trauma-informed care goes beyond simply understanding trauma. It emphasizes creating a therapeutic relationship where clients feel safe, supported, and respected. The therapist recognizes that trauma is personal and can manifest in a variety of ways—emotionally, mentally, and physically. For many clients, trauma may show up in forms such as anxiety, depression, relationship difficulties, low self-esteem, or emotional dysregulation.

As a trauma-informed therapist, my approach is rooted in the following key principles:

- **Safety**: Ensuring clients feel safe both emotionally and physically
- **Trustworthiness**: Maintaining transparency and consistency in the therapy process
- **Empowerment**: Giving clients control over their healing journey
- **Collaboration**: Working as partners in the therapeutic process, respecting the client's autonomy and expertise about their own life
- **Choice**: Encouraging clients to actively participate in the decisions about their healing path

## Core Principles of Trauma-Informed Care

- **Safety**: Establishing a secure space for emotional and physical safety in therapy
- **Trustworthiness and Transparency**: Being open and clear about the therapy process, maintaining confidentiality, and respecting boundaries
- **Peer Support**: Recognizing the value of connection with others who share similar experiences
- **Choice**: Empowering clients by giving them the opportunity to make decisions about their therapy and healing process
- **Collaboration**: Building a partnership with clients, ensuring their voices are heard and respected throughout therapy
- **Empowerment**: Focusing on strengthening clients' sense of self and their ability to navigate life's challenges

## How I Work as a Trauma-Informed Therapist

As a trauma-informed therapist, I integrate these core principles into every aspect of my practice. Here's how I apply this approach to best support my clients:

### Creating a Safe, Supportive Space

My priority is to establish a safe and supportive environment where clients feel comfortable and empowered. I understand that for trauma survivors, vulnerability can be a challenge, and it's essential to create an atmosphere where they feel heard, understood, and validated. I focus on building trust early on and continue to maintain this foundation throughout our work together.

### Recognizing the Impact of Trauma

Trauma affects everyone differently, and I take the time to understand how trauma has specifically impacted my clients' lives. Whether trauma manifests emotionally, mentally, or physically, I approach each individual uniquely. I am trained to recognize subtle signs of trauma, which allows me to work in a way that respects and addresses those experiences.

### Pacing Therapy According to the Client's Readiness

Healing from trauma is a delicate process, and it requires patience. As a trauma-informed therapist, I respect my clients' pacing and work at their speed. Therapy isn't about rushing or pushing clients into uncomfortable territory; it's about gradual, respectful exploration of their experiences and emotions, allowing them to heal at a pace that feels safe and comfortable.

### Empowering Clients Through Choice and Collaboration

A key aspect of trauma-informed care is giving clients a sense of control over their healing journey. In therapy, I prioritize collaboration—working with clients as active partners in their own healing. Together, we set goals, develop strategies, and determine the most effective course of action, always ensuring that their voice is central to the process.

### Integrating the Body in Trauma Healing

Trauma is often stored in the body, and addressing this physical aspect of healing is a core component of my approach. I integrate Somatic Therapy into my practice, utilizing body-based techniques to help clients process and release trauma that may be stored in physical sensations, tension, or disassociation. This somatic approach can be incredibly effective in helping clients reconnect with their bodies and work through the physical manifestations of trauma.

## My Trauma-Informed Training and Expertise

My approach to trauma-informed care is shaped by specialized training and certifications in the field. I have completed:

- **Complex Trauma Certification Training Level 1 & 2 (CCTP/CCTP-II)** with Janina Fisher, a leading expert in trauma therapy. This training deepened my understanding of the complexities of trauma and refined my ability to work with individuals who have experienced complex or prolonged trauma.
- **Somatic Therapy for Complex Trauma Certification Training**, where I learned to integrate somatic (body-based) healing techniques into trauma recovery. This has enhanced my ability to support clients in processing not just the emotional, but also the physical aspects of trauma.

These certifications reflect my dedication to staying at the forefront of trauma-informed care. I continue to expand my knowledge to provide the highest standard of therapy and to offer clients the most effective, compassionate support in their healing journey.

## Why Being Trauma-Informed Matters

Trauma is pervasive, and its effects are far-reaching. Without a trauma-informed approach, traditional therapy methods can inadvertently re-traumatize individuals. Being trauma-informed ensures that clients are treated with the respect, dignity, and care they deserve, while also empowering them to take control of their healing process.

If you're ready to start your journey of healing, I am here to walk alongside you. Together, we can create a safe, collaborative space where you can explore your experiences, understand how trauma has affected your life, and begin to reclaim your well-being.`,

    content: `# Understanding Trauma-Informed Therapy

Trauma-informed therapy is an approach that recognises the widespread impact of trauma and understands potential paths for recovery. It acknowledges that many people seeking therapy have experienced trauma in some form, and this shapes how we engage in the therapeutic process.

## What Makes Therapy Trauma-Informed?

At its core, trauma-informed therapy is built on several key principles:

### Safety
Creating both physical and emotional safety is paramount. This means establishing a predictable, consistent therapeutic relationship where you feel secure enough to explore difficult experiences.

### Trustworthiness and Transparency
I strive to make therapeutic decisions clear and maintain appropriate boundaries. You're always informed about what we're doing in therapy and why.

### Peer Support and Collaboration
Your voice matters. Trauma-informed therapy recognises you as the expert on your own experience. We work together, not with me as the authority telling you what to do.

### Empowerment and Choice
You have control over your healing journey. This might mean choosing what to discuss, at what pace, and what therapeutic approaches feel right for you.

### Cultural Sensitivity
Understanding that trauma and healing are experienced differently across cultures. Your cultural background and identity are honoured and integrated into our work together.

## The Impact of Trauma

Trauma isn't just about what happened to you—it's also about how your nervous system responded. When we experience trauma, our bodies and minds develop protective responses. These might include:

- Hypervigilance or feeling constantly on edge
- Difficulty trusting others
- Emotional numbness or feeling disconnected
- Intense emotional reactions
- Physical symptoms like tension, pain, or fatigue

These responses made sense at the time and helped you survive. Trauma-informed therapy helps you understand these patterns with compassion rather than judgment.

## How We Work With Trauma

In my practice, working with trauma means:

**Starting Where You Are**: We don't rush into processing traumatic memories. We first build resources and stabilisation.

**Body Awareness**: Trauma lives in the body. Through somatic approaches, we learn to listen to your body's signals and help your nervous system find regulation.

**Pacing**: You're in control of the pace. We work within your window of tolerance, ensuring you don't become overwhelmed.

**Building Resources**: Before processing trauma, we develop coping strategies and resources that support you through difficult moments.

**Integration**: Healing isn't just about processing what happened—it's about integrating these experiences into your broader life story in a way that doesn't define you.

## What to Expect

If you're considering trauma-informed therapy, you might wonder what it looks like in practice. Here's what you can expect:

- A thorough, gentle exploration of your history and current concerns
- Collaboration in setting goals that matter to you
- Regular check-ins about how therapy is feeling
- Flexibility in approaches based on what works for you
- Respect for your autonomy and choices
- Attention to the therapeutic relationship itself as a healing space

## Moving Forward

Healing from trauma is possible. It doesn't mean forgetting what happened or that it didn't matter. It means finding ways to live fully in the present, with increased capacity to handle stress, deeper connections with others, and a renewed sense of agency in your life.

If you're considering trauma-informed therapy, taking that first step—even just enquiring—is an act of courage. The journey toward healing is deeply personal, and having the right support can make all the difference.`,

    excerpt: "A compassionate guide to understanding addiction recovery, from recognising the problem to building sustainable sobriety.",
    content: `# The Path to Addiction Recovery: What You Need to Know

Addiction is often misunderstood as a moral failing or lack of willpower. In reality, it's a complex condition that affects the brain, body, and behaviour. Understanding this is the first step toward compassionate, effective recovery.

## Understanding Addiction

Addiction isn't about the substance or behaviour itself—it's about the relationship you have with it. It often develops as a way to cope with:

- Emotional pain or trauma
- Stress and overwhelm
- Feelings of emptiness or disconnection
- Underlying mental health conditions
- Physical pain

The substance or behaviour provides temporary relief, but over time, it begins to cause more problems than it solves.

## The Recovery Journey

Recovery isn't a linear path. It's a process of:

### 1. Recognition
Acknowledging that something needs to change. This takes tremendous courage and often comes after a period of denial.

### 2. Seeking Support
Reaching out for help, whether through therapy, support groups, or trusted individuals in your life.

### 3. Understanding Triggers
Identifying what drives the addictive behaviour—situations, emotions, people, or environments.

### 4. Developing Coping Strategies
Learning healthier ways to manage difficult emotions and situations.

### 5. Building a New Life
Creating meaning, purpose, and connection that supports sustained recovery.

## Specialist Support for Addiction

As a specialist in addiction recovery, I work with you to:

**Explore the Root Causes**: Understanding what the addiction is trying to solve in your life.

**Develop Self-Compassion**: Moving away from shame toward understanding and kindness for yourself.

**Build Resilience**: Creating strategies to handle triggers and high-risk situations.

**Address Co-occurring Issues**: Many people struggling with addiction also deal with trauma, anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns.

**Create Sustainable Change**: Recovery isn't just about stopping the addictive behaviour—it's about building a fulfilling life.

## Relapse Prevention

Relapse doesn't mean failure. It's often part of the recovery process and provides valuable information about what supports you need. We work on:

- Recognising early warning signs
- Creating a relapse prevention plan
- Building a support network
- Developing healthy routines
- Processing difficult emotions without turning to substances

## What Makes Recovery Stick

Long-term recovery often includes:

- **Connection**: Building meaningful relationships and reducing isolation
- **Purpose**: Finding activities and goals that bring meaning to your life
- **Self-Care**: Prioritising physical and emotional well-being
- **Honest Self-Reflection**: Understanding your patterns and triggers
- **Compassion**: Treating yourself with kindness through the ups and downs

## Taking the First Step

If you're struggling with addiction, know that recovery is possible. The first step is often the hardest, but you don't have to do it alone. Specialist therapy provides:

- A non-judgmental space to explore your relationship with substances or behaviours
- Evidence-based approaches tailored to your unique situation
- Support in building the life you want to live
- Compassion and understanding throughout the journey

Recovery is not about perfection—it's about progress, self-discovery, and reclaiming your life. Whether you're just beginning to question your relationship with substances or you're in active recovery, therapeutic support can make a profound difference.`,

    excerpt: "Discover how IFS therapy helps you understand and heal the different parts of yourself that hold pain, protection, and possibility.",
    content: `# Internal Family Systems: Meeting Your Inner Parts

Have you ever noticed that different situations bring out different versions of yourself? Perhaps there's a part of you that's confident and capable, while another part doubts every decision. One part wants to connect with others, while another keeps people at arm's length for safety.

This isn't a sign of confusion or instability—it's a natural aspect of how our minds work. Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy offers a powerful framework for understanding and healing these different parts of ourselves.

## What is IFS?

Developed by Richard Schwartz, IFS is based on the idea that our psyche naturally organises itself into distinct subpersonalities or "parts." Each part has its own perspective, feelings, memories, and goals—and crucially, each part is trying to help us, even when its methods cause problems.

## The Core Concepts

### Parts
These are the different aspects of your personality. You might recognise parts like:
- The Critic who judges your every move
- The Protector who keeps you from taking risks
- The People-Pleaser who prioritises others' needs
- The Achiever who pushes you to succeed
- The Anxious One who worries about everything

### Exiles
These are parts carrying painful emotions and memories, often from childhood. Other parts work hard to keep these exiles hidden because their pain feels overwhelming.

### Managers and Firefighters
These are protective parts. Managers try to control situations to prevent pain, while Firefighters react when pain breaks through, often through distracting or numbing behaviours.

### Self
Beneath all the parts is your core Self—characterised by qualities like curiosity, compassion, clarity, calm, and confidence. In IFS, healing happens when we access this Self-energy to work with our parts.

## How IFS Works in Therapy

The process begins with:

**Noticing Parts**: Becoming aware of when different parts are activated and what they're trying to do.

**Getting to Know Parts**: Approaching each part with curiosity rather than judgment. What is this part trying to protect you from? What does it believe about the world?

**Building Trust**: Parts often don't trust that it's safe to change. We work gradually to build trust within your internal system.

**Unburdening**: When parts feel heard and safe, they can release the extreme beliefs and emotions they've been carrying.

**Integration**: Parts find new, healthier roles within your system, and you develop more access to Self-leadership.

## Why IFS Helps

Traditional therapy sometimes treats symptoms as problems to eliminate. IFS recognises that symptoms are communications from parts trying to help you. This shift from pathologising to curiosity creates profound change.

When you understand that your anxiety isn't a flaw but a part trying to protect you, or that your people-pleasing comes from a part that learned early on that your worth depends on others' approval, you can approach yourself with compassion.

## What to Expect in IFS Therapy

Working with IFS, you might:

- Identify and name your parts
- Have dialogues with parts to understand their concerns
- Witness parts and their stories with compassion
- Help parts release burdens they've been carrying
- Develop Self-leadership so you can navigate life's challenges with more clarity and calm

## The Benefits

People working with IFS often experience:

- **Reduced Internal Conflict**: Parts that once fought against each other learn to work together
- **Greater Self-Compassion**: Understanding that all parts have positive intentions
- **Emotional Regulation**: Developing the capacity to handle difficult feelings
- **Healing Old Wounds**: Processing trauma held by exiled parts
- **Authentic Living**: Less driven by protective parts, more connected to your true Self

## A Personal Invitation

If you find yourself feeling pulled in different directions, struggling with conflicting impulses, or noticing patterns that seem beyond your control, IFS might offer a path forward. It's a gentle, respectful approach that honours the wisdom of your internal system while creating space for healing and growth.

In my practice, I've witnessed profound transformations as people develop compassionate relationships with their parts. It's not about getting rid of any aspect of yourself—it's about helping all your parts find healthier ways to contribute to your life.

You don't need to fix yourself. You're not broken. You have parts that are burdened, and with the right support, those burdens can be lifted, allowing you to live with greater freedom, authenticity, and peace.`,
